# Belly_Button_Challenge
Got significant assistance from my tutor session.
Worked with Kokoe Amegno.
Sources: Stackflow, google, chatgpt
Final working with instructor Shaun McPeck for the demographics information box.
This by far was the most difficult task and a lot of research was required outside of teaching.
Could not push output to github, had to remove and re-add all files based on the html coding that I was unaware of until my tutor showed me.
